# rHub

WHAT: rHub adds hourly staking values to rPlanet elements listed on AtomicHub.

WHY: The current solution is a community managed google document. It is hard and time consuming to look up staking values for each listed element.

HOW: rHub modifies HTML (ONLY) on the Atomic Hub market page. It does not require logins and is simply a front-end skin for an already existing platform. No data is stored, nor sent. 

Example Usage:

1. Install extension: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/rhub/lpnjccocbofcebeofldplhkfnppopjnj
2. Visit https://wax.atomichub.io/market?collection_name=rplanet&order=desc&schema_name=elements&sort=created&symbol=WAX
3. Open the rHub chrome extension
4. Click **SHOW ME THE AE**
